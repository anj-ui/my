    <h1>Welcome to My Personal Page</h1>
   
    <p>Hi! My name is <b>Anjenette L. Saplad</b>, and I am a <b>BSIT student.</b> 
         I am passionate about technology and electronics. In my free time, I enjoy gaming, watching movies, drawing, and practicing the guitar.
         I also love listening to music by artists like NIKI, Ariana Grande, and Bruno Mars, as well as watching K-pop artists like BLACKPINK, BTS, Enhypen, IU, and Somi.
         My favorite movie genres are action, thriller, crime, and suspense.
    </p>
    <p>I am someone who deeply values friendship and genuine connections.
       While I sometimes find communication a bit challenging, I always try my best to express myself and listen to others. 
       I also want to challenge myself to step out of my comfort zone and become a more confident version of myself as I pursue my degree.
    </p>
